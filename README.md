1. Register to ICICI direct.
2. Here is the [link](https://api.icicidirect.com/apiuser/home) to the breeze home.
3. Follow [these](https://www.icicidirect.com/ilearn/stocks/articles/how-to-generate-session-key) to generate session key. You will need the following link along with your api key to get session key - "https://api.icicidirect.com/apiuser/login?api_key="
4. For the above steps, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWCIO4Ujtx0&list=PLL6qcyIr49JnccaviGh0Nu3IwgKT62GNd&index=1) video cal be followed as well. We do not follow the remaining steps from step 3 because we want the session key to be generated automatically.
5. *(Under development)* For auto login, follow the step shown in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2LPMLVo59o&list=PLL6qcyIr49JnccaviGh0Nu3IwgKT62GNd&index=11) video around timestamp 0:45 to enable login authenticator by going to the settings in [ICICI direct home page](https://secure.icicidirect.com/trading/equity/home). We do this step to generate an ICICI direct Pin either via web or mobile app.
